# Brain_CT_scan_prediction_model
This script facilitates the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to detect the presence of tumors in MRI/CT scans of patients. 
Additionally, it enables batch prediction of outcomes for multiple scans stored within a folder, streamlining the analysis process.
